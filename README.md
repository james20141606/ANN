## Introduction
This repository is the course work in Artificial Neural Network taught by teachers in Computer Science department. It give me the knowledge and ability to know deep learning systemically and apply them to other fields including imaging and bioinformatics more freely. <br>
I am very interested in deep learning so I attend this course in 2017 autumn. It is a huge challenge for me since my coding ability also lags behind other students in computer science major. Through the four homework and a project design, I learned to write MLP and CNN without tensorflow or other platform. Then I tried to use CNN, batch normalization and dropout by using Tensorflow. The last homework needs us to use RNN kind model to solve a NLP problem.
