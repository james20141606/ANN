## Introduction
This repository is the course work in Artificial Neural Network taught by teachers in Computer Science department. <br>
I am very interested in deep learning so I attend this course in 2017 autumn. It is a huge challenge for me since my coding ability also lags behind other students in computer science major. Through the four homework and a project design, I learned to write MLP and CNN without tensorflow or other platform. Then I tried to use CNN, batch normalization and dropout by using Tensorflow. The last homework needs us to use RNN kind model to solve a NLP problem.
